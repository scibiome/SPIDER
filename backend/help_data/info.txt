Both short-term outcomes (immune and endocrine indices), as well as 3-year recurrence rates will be assessed within patients. Specifically, we propose a double blind clinical trial with two major arms: (I) placebo treatment, and (II) treatment with a cocktail of a B-blocker (propranolol  €  to block catecholamines, oral tablet 40 mg , 3 times daily) and a COX2 inhibitor (etodolac  €  to block prostaglandin receptors, 200 mg oral tablets every 6 hours ). A total of 206 patients will be recruited. The drug treatment will be given for a total of 20-day period, commencing five days before surgery, with no time overlap with adjuvant therapy, and independently of any other routine therapy. The drug treatment is planned for only 15 post-operative days to reduce potential side effects, and because most immunological and endocrine perturbations induced by surgery dissipate during this period. Immune and endocrine baseline levels will be established in a group of thirty healthy matched control subjects.<br>Short-term endocrine and immune measures will include: serum levels of various cytokines; serum cortisol, C-reactive protien, Vascular endothelial growth factor,  leukocyte subpopulations and their functional markers; and Natural killar cells activity.

A significant increase in the expression of genes containing the Vitamin D responsive element (VDRE), in tumour tissue, in patients receiving active study medication compared to placebo.<br><br>Previously published data on the effects of vitamin D on gene expression in a colorectal cancer cell line will be used to identify genes that are responsive to vitamin D.  Affymetrix microarray data from these experiments are available from the NCBI GEO database under the accession number GSE444. In addition, genes representing vitamin D targets in normal colon tissues will be identified by searching publically available colon array databases for expressed genes which contain the VDRE.  The VDRE element is present within the promoter region of genes activated by vitamin D and therefore acts as a convenient tag to identify vitamin D responsive genes.<br><br>RNA will be isolated from CRC samples from 50 patients, half of whom will have received vitamin D.  RNA expression profiles of the 50 tumour RNA samples will then be generated in the Otago Genomics Facility using Affymetrix HG-U133+2.0 GeneChips. Evidence of activation of vitamin D pathways in the tumours from treated and untreated patients will be determined using the vitamin D responsive genes identified above.  This will be accomplished by generating a vitamin D meta-gene to represent the coordinated expression of these genes across all tumours, so that tumours exhibiting a molecular response to vitamin D will have high levels of the meta-gene.  This meta-gene will then be tested for association with treatment status, as well as clinicopathological (e.g. tumour stage, histology etc), molecular (e.g. proliferation) and immune reponse  variables.[Tissue samples will be collected on the day of surgery.

Following diagnosis of endometrial cancer and informed consent, prior to planned elective surgery, tumour tissue will be collected by pipelle biopsy. This biopsy is in addition to standard care, and it will be taken in an outpatient setting. The pipelle biopsy is a commonly performed outpatient procedure and in fact many patients will have experienced this as their diagnostic procedure. The procedure involves insertion of a vaginal speculum and the introduction of a fine plastic tube into the uterus. Material from within the uterine cavity is sucked into the tube by applying negative pressure.  For the purpose of the study the biopsy will be performed by the named clinical investigators who are highly experienced at this procedure, and the patients will have a good understanding of the required procedure. Appropriate oral and local analgesia will be given in consultation with the patient. The procedure will be performed in a safe clinical environment with appropriate analgesia and a nurse assistant. Adverse events associated with the pipelle biopsy will be recorded.<br>2. Patients usually proceed to surgery approximately two  €  four weeks from the initial diagnostic biopsy. Within this time frame, Vitamin C administration will be co-ordinated to start five days before the planned surgical removal of the endometrial tumour. <br>2. Vitamin C will be administered by intravenous infusion daily for four days prior to surgery, beginning with a dose of 25 g, then 1g/kg capped at a maximum of 75 g.  <br>3.

ISRCTN16867955	A randomised phase 3 trial evaluating the role of finasteride in increasing compliance with active surveillance, in men with a new diagnosis of low and intermediate risk prostate cancer, when compared with usual care.		Ongoing	Men with a new diagnosis of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer <br>Cancer <br>Malignant neoplasm of prostate	<br>                FINESSE is a multicentre, open label, prospective, two-armed randomised controlled CTIMP, to test the superiority of finasteride and active surveillance over- active surveillance alone, in men with newly diagnosed low/intermediate risk localised prostate cancer.<br><br>                We will randomise (1:1), 550 patients to Active Surveillance with or without once daily finasteride, (5mg). Patients will receive finasteride for 2 years and will be followed up for an average of 4 years. Active surveillance will include PSA, re-biopsy and mpMRI as per usual NHS care. The primary outcome is adherence with Active Surveillance in both arms.<br><br>                 €  There are no placebo treatments for the following reasons:  The PSA levels in men treated with finasteride will almost halve. Since it is necessary to monitor PSA (for AS) this would unblind both arms unless clinicians and patients were blinded to the PSA results.<br>                 €  Blinding PSA data would be impractical, since men may actively seek PSA tests outside the study.<br>                 €  It is ethical that control patients experiencing any side effects, e.g., erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory problems, or a rash, know they are independent of the treatment.<br>                 €  Participants unaware they are taking finasteride may opt for radical treatment earlier. This is a pragmatic trial designed to see whether knowing that they are being treated and that the treatment is having a positive impact on PSA levels would reassure men and enable them to continue with active surveillance for longer, rather than seeking radical treatment even though their disease may not have progressed.<br>                 €  The prohibitive costs   logistics associated with placebo-controlled trials<br><br>                Randomisation:<br>	Adherence with Active Surveillance at 2 and 5 years after diagnosis.

Current standard therapy for metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer is paclitaxel in combination with trastuzumab and pertuzumab, followed by continuation of HER2-directed therapy until progression. The addition of PCZ has the potential for enhanced anticancer effect, but this novel combination needs to be assessed for feasibility and safety.<br><br>Interventions:<br>Standard treatment with paclitaxel 80mg/m2 weekly and loading dose trastuzumab 8mg/kg and pertuzumab 840mg. From cycle 2, paclitaxel 80mg/m2 weekly, trastuzumab 6mg/kg and pertuzumab 420mg every 3 weeks in combination with de-escalating doses of PCZ given as 6 weekly treatments.<br><br> € <br><br>Prochlorperazine Administration:<br>Prochlorperazine will be administered as an intravenous infusion at a given dose level over 20 minutes, 60 minutes following the administration of cycle 2 of the standard treatment regimen of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and paclitaxel. The reason for this is that dexamethasone, which may impact ADCC, is not required from cycle 2 of the treatment. <br><br>On completion of the prochlorperazine infusion, the intravenous line will be flushed with 100ml 0.9  normal saline. The standard reconstitution of prochlorperazine is within a solution of the mesylate salt in 5  dextrose. As the dose per infusion varies depending on body size and dose level, the concentration of the infusion will differ: for instance, an expected dose of prochlorperazine would be 50-100mg diluted in 250ml for a 1-2mg/5ml concentration solution running over 20 minutes.<br><br>Prochlorperazine is given over 6 weeks, start	The primary objective is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), defined as the highest dose level achieved with prochlorperazine in combination with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel where less than 33  patients enrolled have experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT).<br><br>Dose limiting toxicity assessed by the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) graded by the Investigator per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0)<br><br>Patients will be assessed for the presence of a DLT during their routine clinical assessments. which includes history, physical examination, and performance status, as well as at the end of their treatment and safety assessment. [Clinical assessments - Participants will be reviewed by their study investigator weekly during the prochlorperazine infusions, then every 3 weeks. Subsequent clinical assessment frequency is at the discretion of the investigator.<br><br>An end of treatment and safety assessment should be performed at 21 days after the last dose of study treatment to identify any adverse events occurring within this time.

The dose may be further escalated to 6 g per day, in three evenly divided doses, subject to no significant intolerance and study PI approval. <br>Participant acetylator status, which affects how quickly sulfasalazine is processed in the body, is used to inform the dose escalation schedule during the first treatment cycle.  For fast acetylators, the sulfasalazine dose is expected to increase to 3g per day on Day 4, further escalated to the target dose on Day 8 and may be further escalated to 6g per day on Day 15 subject to tolerability and PI approval. For slow acetylators, the dose is expected to increase to 3g per day on Day 8, further escalated to the target dose on Day 15 and may be further escalated to 6g per day on Day 22 subject to tolerability and PI approval.<br>All participants will continue the study treatment until clinical or radiological progression or until treatment discontinuation criteria are met.

Recruiting	Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukaemia; <br>Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukaemia;Cancer - Leukaemia - Chronic leukaemia	This prospective study will assess whether treatment responses for participants with Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukaemia can be improved by targeting certain mutation sub-groups based on individual molecular profiling. <br><br>As part of the screening process, participants will be required to have a bone marrow aspirate and trephine.  During this procedure, 9 mL of bone marrow aspirate will be collected for central mutation profiling which is a test used to detect certain acquired mutations that can be present in CMML.  The most common genes affected in CMML include TET2 and a group of genes belonging to the RAS pathway (NRAS/KRAS/CBL).  Both TET2 and RAS pathway genes contribute to CMML, but the way in which they work is different.  As a result, we need to tailor our medications specifically to switch them off.  Before participants are enrolled in this research study, we will need to assess whether either of these groups of genes have been affected in their case.  If they are, the participant may be eligible for this study.  Genetic testing is complex and it will take approximately 3 weeks for results to become available.<br><br>Participants with RAS pathway mutations in will receive lenzilumab in combination with azacitidine, while patients with TET2 mutations will receive sodium ascorbate plus azacitidine.

A total of 160 patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be probabilistically allocated to one or the other intervention group using a table of random numbers. Patients received perioperative chemotherapy, that is, before and after surgery, and will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to two experimental groups, the first (80 patients regardless of gender) that will receive treatment based on 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU ) and the second (80 patients with the same gender distribution as the first group) who will receive 5-FU and menadione. Both the researchers who will assess the outcomes and the participants will not know to which group each participant belongs. Neoadjuvant treatment (before surgery) consisted of four cycles of two weeks (8 weeks). Patients must be operated on within 28 days of completing the fourth course of treatment. After recovery from the surgical procedure, patients who have not progressed previously will be treated with four additional cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (after surgery) at the same doses and intervals as neoadjuvant treatment. Thirty days after the end of the last cycle of treatment, an appointment will be held and patients will be referred for routine care. Patients will be followed up for 24 months after resection. The following regimen will be administered to patients in the FLOT group on the first day of the cycle: a) Docetaxel, for two hours of intravenous infusion, at 50 mg/m2; b) Oxaliplatin, for two hours of intravenous infusion, at 85 mg/m2 in 500 ml of 5  glucose; c) Leucovorin, for one hour of intravenous infusion, at 200 mg/m2 in 250 ml of 0.9  sodium chloride; d)5-FU, for 24 hours of intravenous infusion, at 2600 mg/m2.
